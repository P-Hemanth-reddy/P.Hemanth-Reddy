<h1 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;text-align: center;background-color:greenyellow;">A short note on Renewable energy</h1>
<h1 style="font-family: 'Verdana', Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: ;font-size: small;padding-top: 10px;background-color: beige;">Renewable energy refers to energy derived from naturally replenishing sources,
     which are inexhaustible in nature. Unlike fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, which take millions of years to form and are finite in supply, renewable energy sources harness the power of nature, ensuring
      a perpetual supply of clean energy. <mark>These sources include solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal energy.</mark> </h1>
